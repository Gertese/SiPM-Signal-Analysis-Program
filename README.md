# SiPM-Signal-Analysis-Program

## Attention！
Vision 1.0 needs to install Matlab firstly. After Vision 1.0, Runtime is required to install firstly.

By the way, Runtime should be install at C:Program files//MATLAB.

Vision 1.0: SiPM Signal Analysis Program.mlappinstaller

Vision 2.0: SSAP2.0installer.exe

Vision 2.5: SSAP2.5installer.exe

## statement

There are some fatal bugs in Vision 1.0 & Vision 2.0. I strongly recommand all users to install the lastest SSAP.  

More details are included in the brochure.
